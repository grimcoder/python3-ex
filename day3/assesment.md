### Assessment:

1. **OOP**:
    - Define a class `Vehicle` with attributes `make` and `year` and methods to get details of the vehicle. Extend this class to create another class `Car` which has an additional attribute `model` and also extends the details method to include model information.

2. **File Handling**:
    - Read a file containing JSON data and convert it into a Python dictionary. Modify the dictionary and write it back to a different JSON file.

3. **Error and Exception Handling**:
    - Write a function that accepts two numbers and divides them. This function should raise a custom exception `InvalidNumberError` when any of the numbers is negative. Handle this exception in the calling code.

4. **Comprehensions**:
    - Given a list of words, use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only words that have more than 4 letters.

5. **Generators**:
    - Write a generator function that yields even numbers from 0 to a given number `n`.

6. **Decorators**:
    - Create a decorator `print_args` that prints the arguments and the result of the function it decorates.

7. Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter.
8. Write a function that reads a `.txt` file and counts the number of occurrences of a specified word.
9. Create a list comprehension that gets all the even numbers from 1 to 100.
10. Write a generator function that simulates a countdown, taking a number `n` as a parameter and counting down to 0.
