1. **List Manipulation**: 
    - Given a list of integers, write a function that returns a new list containing only the odd numbers.
    - Example input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - Example output: `[1, 3, 5]`

2. **Tuple Operations**: 
    - Given a tuple containing several strings, write a function that returns the string with the maximum length.
    - Example input: `("apple", "banana", "cherry")`
    - Example output: `"banana"`

3. **Dictionary Actions**: 
    - Write a function that swaps the keys and values in a dictionary.
    - Example input: `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`
    - Example output: `{1: "a", 2: "b"}`

4. **Function Creation**: 
    - Write a function `calculate_area` that takes the base and height of a triangle and returns its area.

5. **Using the Math Module**: 
    - Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints its square root using the `math` module.

6. **File Reading/Writing**:
    - Write a program that reads a file, counts the number of words in it, and then writes the result to a new file called `word_count.txt`.

7. **Exception Handling**:
    - Write a function that takes two numbers as input. It should try to divide the first number by the second number and print the result. Handle any exceptions that might arise, such as dividing by zero or entering a non-numeric value.

8. **Using the Datetime Library**:
    - Write a function that prints the current date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

9. **Exploring Packages**:
    - Use the `os` module to list all files in your current directory and print their sizes.

10. **Creating a Simple Package**: 
    - Create a package named "utilities". Inside this package, create two modules: `string_utils` and `number_utils`. In `string_utils`, write a function to reverse a string. In `number_utils`, write a function to check if a number is prime. Import and use these functions in a main program.

Remember, the best way to learn is to practice. These exercises are designed to be challenging yet achievable. Try to solve them on your own, and when you're stuck or unsure, refer back to resources, documentation, or the information I provided on Day 2. Good luck!
