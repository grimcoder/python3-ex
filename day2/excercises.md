### **Exercises for Day 2**:

1. **Data Structures**: Given a list of numbers, write a function that returns a list containing only the even numbers.
2. **Functions**: Write a function that takes two strings and returns the concatenated result.
3. **Modules**: Use the `math` module to compute the factorial of a number.
4. **File I/O**: Write a program that reads a file, modifies its content (e.g., converting all text to uppercase), and writes the modified content back to the file.
5. **Exception Handling**: Write a function that takes two numbers as strings, converts them to integers, divides them, and returns the result. Handle any exceptions that may arise.
6. **Libraries**: Use the `datetime` library to determine how many days have passed since the start of the year.

This concludes Day 2. After completing the exercises, you'll be well-versed with intermediate Python concepts!
