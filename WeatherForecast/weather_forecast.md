## **Weatherly**: A Weather Forecasting Application

### **Day 1: Setting Up and Basic Infrastructure**

**Objective**: Get the foundational pieces in place.

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up a new virtual environment for Python.
   - Install necessary packages (`Flask`, `requests`, etc.).

2. **Basic Flask Application**:
   - Create a basic Flask application to serve as our backend.

3. **Amazon Cognito Setup**:
   - Set up an Amazon Cognito User Pool named `WeatherlyUserPool` for user management.
   - Configure signup and login functionality.

### **Day 2: Building the Weather Service & Database Setup**

**Objective**: Build the core functionality and set up data storage.

1. **Weather Service**:
   - Fetch weather data using an external weather API. You can use APIs like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.
   - Transform this data into a user-friendly format.

2. **DynamoDB Setup**:
   - Set up an AWS DynamoDB table named `WeatherlyForecasts` to store user-specific weather preferences and forecasts.
   - Implement CRUD operations in your Flask application interfacing with this table.

### **Day 3: Integration with AWS Lambda & API Gateway**

**Objective**: Convert the Flask application into AWS Lambda-compatible format and expose via API Gateway.

1. **Lambda Conversion**:
   - Use frameworks like `Zappa` or `Serverless` to convert the Flask app to be AWS Lambda compatible.
   - Deploy the functions to AWS Lambda.

2. **API Gateway Integration**:
   - Create a new API in Amazon API Gateway named `WeatherlyAPI`.
   - Set up routes/resources that correspond to our application's endpoints.
   - Integrate these routes with the respective AWS Lambda functions.

### **Day 4: Frontend Development and Cognito Integration**

**Objective**: Develop a user-friendly frontend and integrate with backend services.

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Develop a basic web frontend using frameworks like React or Vue.js.
   - Connect the frontend to the backend endpoints exposed via API Gateway.

2. **Cognito Integration on Frontend**:
   - Use Amazon Cognito's SDK to facilitate user signup and login on the frontend.
   - Handle and manage user sessions.

### **Day 5: Final Touches, Deployment, and Testing**

**Objective**: Fine-tune the application, deploy frontend, and perform tests.

1. **Enhancements and Bug Fixes**:
   - Optimize Lambda functions.
   - Refactor any code, if necessary.

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Use Amazon S3 to host the static website.
   - Enable the S3 bucket for static website hosting and upload the frontend files.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the entire flow from user signup, login, fetching weather, and storing preferences.
   - Ensure error handling is in place and user experience is smooth.

By the end of this 5-day plan, you'll have a fully functional serverless weather forecasting application with user management, data storage, and a responsive frontend.
